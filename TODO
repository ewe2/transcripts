This is a version-controlled collection of transcriptions from memos done with
the transcriber program from the debian etch distribution. Unless required,
the files remain in the native XML format of transcriber, although they can be
converted to other formats.

The idea of the memos came from learning that philip adams writes his columns
by dictation and i thought perhaps if i made a habit of recording my thoughts
i might have a better chance of retaining insights i often lose in the process
of thinking about topics i want to write about although i had already tried
some lengthy memos before i heard of phil's method.

Obviously the memos themselves won't be VC'd but they will be kept otherwise.
Any other information or changes to the archive will be mentioned here. It's
likely I'll have to write an xsl file to make the transcriptions more readable
say for web-based reading. To that end I archive the dtd to make xsl
development simpler.

the Makefile will be designed along the lines of the mdate Makefile where
specific or all targets are transcriptions to output in text or html
eventually.

we'll build a similar tool to svn2cl. have the stylesheet take parameters from
the script so we can vary the output. two stylesheets, default will be text,
html optional. README now describes the project, this is for personal working
notes.

the basic gruntwork has been done, we can now worry about the translation
details, the build system and version control. Get another Google translation
of all Transcriber documentation
(http://trans.sourceforge.net/en/transguid.php (incomplete).
