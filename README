===========================================

This is a project based on the tcl tool transcriber, saved here are not only
transcripts in native XML format (.trs) but tools to convert their data into
readable transcripts.

The project is planned in several stages:

build the stylesheets - basically completed
build the tools that use them - done
finish translating transcriber and modify the system.

Taking each in turn, the stylesheets are intented to output to text and html
from the XML trs format and will take parameters from a command-line script
wrapper, similar to the method of svn2cl. The parameters will include such
things as linelength, transcription levels, and optional attributes.
Transcriber allows great transcription detail, but is unfortunately
incompletely translated at that depth and will require modification to fix
this. Thus its desireable to simplifiy transformation in
sections until this is done, or if the detail is neither complete nor wished.

The programs html2text and tidy will be required to build the output,
currently two transcripts are supported, more will be added as they are done.
