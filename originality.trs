ok time for a small bitch i just ah just got the kiwix 0.version of the offline wikipedia reader, some interesting articles and one of them's about cyberpunk literary phenomenonand i've just got a small little whine because- 
<Sync time="21.461"/>
ah David Brin made some very useful points he's ahe's usually a bit of a tease as a writer 
<Sync time="29.221"/>
he's got very interesting viewpoints
<Sync time="31.622"/>
um particularly for instance on Star Wars I think it was him that
<Sync time="36.109"/>
posited that Star Wars itself was evil and George Lucas was the evil
<Event desc="b" type="noise" extent="instantaneous"/>

<Sync time="40.671"/>
evil for um inventing it
<Sync time="42.882"/>
um he's asking the point you know that ah
<Sync time="47.431"/>

<Event desc="b" type="noise" extent="previous"/>

<Sync time="48.94"/>
cyberpunk was a-a useful promotion for science fiction in general
<Sync time="54.555"/>
but not particularly original and i wanna
<Sync time="57.189"/>
pick up on this because the article has pointed to many of the
<Sync time="62.107"/>
precursors of cyberpunk but when we talk about cyberpunk
<Sync time="66.605"/>
what we're really talking about is a labelled that ah

a certain-
<Sync time="75.207"/>
the popularity of certain science fiction novels, we're not really
<Sync time="79.827"/>
talking - i mean that - about something that's -
<Sync time="83.052"/>
all that terribly distinct
<Sync time="85.691"/>
um... it's one of those buzzwords that come around
<Sync time="90.491"/>
but his point about "oh you know, cyberpunk great
<Sync time="95.593"/>
promotional tool but hardly original" i wanna make an argument that i-
<Sync time="103.431"/>
ah i often see this kind of um
<Sync time="111.519"/>
i guess ah what'd you call it a um
<Sync time="115.352"/>
almost a political tool used whenever you want to discredit
<Sync time="120.603"/>
ah something that's come up you don't
<Sync time="125.029"/>
exactly agree with you say "oh they're not original"
<Sync time="128.003"/>
i'm sick of hearing this, i've been reading
<Sync time="132.175"/>
stuff about the um the supposed "unoriginality" of Linux
<Sync time="137.926"/>
because it was based on Minix and 
<Sync time="140.323"/>
the simple point is that you don't-
<Sync time="142.904"/>
noone starts from scratch everybody
<Sync time="145.569"/>
starts with

the bones of a good idea from somewhere else
<Sync time="151.899"/>
for instance the sourcecode of an existing program
<Sync time="156.307"/>
ah maybe you want to make a change or do something
<Sync time="161.347"/>
ah different with it and ah eventually the ah product evolves into something that's new
<Sync time="169.019"/>
but that's a process of evolution, it's not
<Sync time="172.972"/>
a question of whether
<Sync time="175.415"/>
you're original or not, i used to be
<Sync time="178.336"/>
quite concerned with that phrase
<Sync time="181.211"/>
once ah i as a musician
<Sync time="184.478"/>
i used to think that
<Sync time="186.448"/>
you had to be original there was this real thing to be original it took me years to realize its impossible to be original
<Sync time="193.857"/>
and yes there is the um
<Sync time="197.387"/>
the old line ah from picasso that "great artists steal whereas good artists borrow" and
<Sync time="206.511"/>
we've now entered a
<Sync time="210.837"/>
almost an ideological but definitely a legal cultural world where borrowing is definitely not permitted
<Sync time="219.207"/>
and lawrence lessig has made a um
<Sync time="223.093"/>
passionate point about that
<Sync time="225.539"/>
arguing that if we clamp down
<Sync time="231.059"/>
on the rights of the public domain,
<Sync time="234.607"/>
at the rate that we're doing once there is no public domain there will not be any great creativity because nobody will have anything to base
<Sync time="245.744"/>
their work on, you cannot work in a vaccum, i've never, it's a very very rare instance where something new has come along 
<Sync time="257.972"/>
say you're you know give or take, ah err as lessig himself argued ah
<Sync time="265.626"/>
any major invention of the last 150 years normally had about 3 or 4 people
<Sync time="274.632"/>
come up with the idea independently, sometimes in relationship to each other, it's quite rare
<Sync time="281.056"/>
um and maybe one person had the best implementation of that
<Sync time="287.56"/>
and they were called the inventor or the originator of it um there was ah many years ago a
<Sync time="295.934"/>
i noticed that different countries would claim that their person had invent-independentally invented ah radio for instance everybody was claiming
<Sync time="308.756"/>
that their own country had invented radio it was impossible of course
<Sync time="314.044"/>
no way um
<Sync time="318.268"/>
that any one person had invented radio it was a series of accidents
<Sync time="323.335"/>
sometimes the wily, in the caze of edison and marconi got, got there first
<Sync time="329.57"/>
but often there was something missing that somebody else added that made it worthwhile
<Sync time="334.632"/>
ah and
<Sync time="339.168"/>
the argument that - coming back to the cyberpunk argument
<Sync time="343.266"/>
"cyberpunk isn't original" but that's not the point, the point is that
<Sync time="348.007"/>
a certain fashion - literary fashion - arose
<Sync time="353.21"/>
and acted upon and gave birth to
<Sync time="358.117"/>
an arguably distinct genre narrow as it is because
<Sync time="363.028"/>
i mean when we're talking about the genre of cyberpunk we're really arguing about
<Sync time="367.087"/>
a certain style of science fiction it's not, it's not as if
<Sync time="372.314"/>
it's a completely distinct field of its own
<Sync time="377.438"/>
so when people argue "were they original?" ok well, so what?
<Sync time="383.222"/>
what if they, what if they weren't? why is that, why is that pertinent?
<Sync time="388.61"/>
why is any of that pertinent, it's impossible to be original
<Sync time="395.26"/>
ah as we know the origin "the origin" see that's where the word comes from it's a greek root
<Sync time="405.478"/>
to originate something, as Tolkien made one of his characters observe, is too great a claim for any, the best we can do is work with what we're given
<Sync time="418.274"/>
and do our best with that, somebody else will pick it up and take it on
<Sync time="426.328"/>
and so the story goes on, so we're only part of, we didn't start it, we're certainly not going to end it
<Sync time="435.972"/>
and ah i believe that's what people should be cognisant of
<Sync time="442.876"/>
when you have arguments like this because it, it basically, all the argument "it's not original" is meant to do is to tell you
<Sync time="454.16"/>
"oh its not exciting, it's not new, it's not progress, please ignore it because it threatens us"
